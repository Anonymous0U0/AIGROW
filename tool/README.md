# AIGROW
---
### Introduction
---
The source code of AIGROW is organized here. The code is different for different model checkers. Therefore, we organize a separate folder for each model checker.

### File Organization
---
For the different model checkers, the code is organized in a similar way. We take ABC-pdr as an example. The file organization is as follow:
```
|-- pdr-feedback
    |-- aigerfile_thread                  // the aiger files generated by AIGROW are stored here
        |-- ...
    |--bin
        |-- GraFuzzer_nolimit.py          // the generator
        |-- abc                           // model checker
        |-- aigtoaig                      // the tool for converting from aag format to aig format
    |-- result_thread
        |-- record.txt                    // the results record file
        |-- relation.txt                  // the parent-child extension relationships of aiger files are recorded in here 
    |-- temp
    |-- feedback_pdr.py                   // implemention of the feedback-guided strategy
    |-- generate_thread.sh
    |-- re_generate_thread.sh
    |-- params                            // parameters configure file
```
### Installation
---
First, We need to install the model checker.
-   Obtain the latest version of ABC-pdr at:
> [https://github.com/berkeley-abc/abc](https://github.com/berkeley-abc/abc)
-   Obtain the latest version of IC3-ref at:
> [https://github.com/arbrad/IC3ref](https://github.com/arbrad/IC3ref)
-   Obtain the latest version of SimpleCAR at:
> [TODO?](https://github.com/lijwen2748/simplecar)

### Usage
---
1. Add the model checker into bin/. For example, add the executable file *abc* into bin/ folder. 
2. To run AIGROW: python3 feedback_xxx.py. Take ABC-pdr as an example:
```
python3 feedback_pdr.py
```
